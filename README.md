## Special Instructions
Any unique eight-bit (byte) character could serve as data element separator, segment terminator, or subelement separator, provided
each character is disjoint from all data elements within an interchange and that these do not conflict with telecommunications
protocols necessary to the transmission of the interchange. The
following recommended values conform with information published in Electronic Data Interchange, X12 Standards, Version 3, Release 5, Interchange Control Structures, Section 4.3 Delimiter
Specifications.
### Data Element Separator
While the data element separator is graphically displayed as an
asterisk (*) in ASC X12 documentation, it is the value employed
in the fourth byte of an interchange envelope that actually assigns
the separator that the translators will use throughout an interchange.ASC X12 recommends the ASCII character with hexadecimal value
"1D" for use as the data element separator (gs).
data_element_separator = "\x1D"
### Segment Terminator
 ASC X12 documentation usually portrays this as a new line (n/l) character,
occurring immediately following the ISA16 segment.
ASC X12 recommends the ASCII character with hexadecimal value
"1C" for use as the segment (fs) terminator.
segment_terminator = "\x1C"
### Subelement Separator
(ISA16) for defining the subelement separator within an interchange. Although designated as reserved for future expansion in Version 3, Release 5, a
value in ISA16 is required.
ASC X12 recommends the ASCII character with hexadecimal value
"1F" for use as the subelement separation (us) character.
subelement_separator = "\x1F"
